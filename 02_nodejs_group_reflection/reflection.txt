As a Project Manager, I have contributed a significant amount of work for its initial completion.
My team has faced many challenges inlcuding schedules, time constraints, and even lack of knowledge or skills
in order for us to deliver our project to where it is now. I learned that anything can be done with the help 
of God and the right mindset. I also learned that teamwork is key to success and that communication is the
foundation for improvement. I also learned that time management is crucial in order to meet deadlines and to deliver
results.

We have learned that through teamwork, support, dedication, and collaboration, we can overcome these challenges 
together as long as we continue to understand and give our best in our roles. We have also learned that the key to 
success is to be flexible and adapt to any situation that may arise. At first, the communication of our group had a rocky 
start. But with constant effort and practice, we were able to improve our communication skills and work together as a team.
All we needed was time to get to know how each other worked and constant communication.

As a project manager, I want to work on my communication skills and how I present myself to my team as I can sometimes be
a little overbearing and intimidating at times. I would also like to improve on my communication skills
